# Given that the worst-case scenario involves comparing each node in tree 1 to every node in tree 2 (or vice versa),
# and that each node's children are also iterated over and compared, 
#the overall time complexity can be considered in terms of operations performed on each node and its children:

# For each node in tree 1, you potentially compare it with nodes in tree 2.
# You also generate child nodes maps for nodes in both trees and perform recursive comparisons.
# Thus, in the most straightforward analysis, assuming that you might have to visit and compare each node in one tree with each node in the other in the worst case,
#the time complexity would be proportional to the product of the number of nodes in each tree, i.e., 

# O(NÃ—M). 
# However, due to the nature of the comparison (which does not actually compare every node in tree 1 with every node in tree 2 directly,
#but rather traverses the trees in a sort of parallel fashion), the practical time complexity is more nuanced and depends on the structure of the trees
# and how the nodes and their children are distributed.

# The real bottleneck comes from the iterations over the children of each node and the recursive calls made for these children.
#If we assume that the distribution of nodes is somewhat even and each node only makes a limited number of recursive calls to its children,
#the effective time complexity is closer to 
# O(N+M),
# because each node in both trees is processed at most once in the case of non-overlapping trees.
